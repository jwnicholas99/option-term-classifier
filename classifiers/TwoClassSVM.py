        Note that there might be more than 2 classes, such as when using the TransductiveExtractor.
        As the SVC is a multi-class classifier, this will still work.

        Note that when using the TransductiveExtractor, there are 3 classes: 
            1. Positive (1)
            2. Negative, in subgoal traj (0)
            3. Negative, all states outside subgoal traj (2)
        As the positive class still has label 1, predict works when trained with data from the 
        TransductiveExtractor and other label extractors that only have 2 classes.
